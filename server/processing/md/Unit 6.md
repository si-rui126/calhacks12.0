## 6.1 Factors Influencing Amylase Activity

Molecular structure corresponds with physiological funcon (form = funcon). Therefore, to
catalyze specific chemical reacons, enzymes must have a precise shape. Several environmental
factorstemperature, pH, and the presence or absence of cofactorscan impact the efficiency
of enzymes.


Enzymes, like other proteins, are sensive to changes in their environment. Extremely high

temperatures can disrupt the bonds and interacons between amino acids in a protein. As a

result, the enzyme is incapable of maintaining its shape and therefore unfolds, becoming inacve.

This process of a protein losing structure and funconality is called protein **denaturaon** . At

extremely low temperatures, the enzyme may be properly folded, but molecules move more
slowly so reacon rates are slowed. For every enzyme, there is an _optimal_ temperature at which
the enzyme°Øs acvity is greatest. You will determine the opmal temperature for amylase acvity.


In addion to temperature, pH can influence the shape and acvity of an enzyme. Further, many
proteins require non-protein components (oen metallic ions like Mg [2+] or Ca [2+] ), known as

cofactors, for enzyme funcon. These concepts will be covered in more detail later in this Unit.


_**FIGURE 1:**_ _Protein denaturation._

### **EXPERIMENT OVERVIEW**


In Unit 5 you used a mixture of Iodine (I) and potassium iodide (IK) called Lugol°Øs iodine. Lugol°Øs

iodine is a yellowish-brown color that stains a blue-black color in the presence of starch (see

Figure 4 in Unit 5), but not in the presence of maltose or glucose. As starch hydrolysis takes place,

the soluon will show intermediate shades of brownish-black, indicang that only some of the

starch remains.


Any test in which a color change is used to indicate the presence of a chemical or molecule is

called a colorimetric test. Here you will track the breakdown of starch into maltose by observing

the soluon change color from blue-black, through brown to yellow. When evaluang the

presence of starch, only consider the starch to be absent if the color is completely yellow. If some

brown or blue-black remains, consider that some starch is present. **Recall that amylase breaks**
**down starch, so if starch is sll present (black/brown), amylase is either not present or is not**
**working effecvely. A yellow color means amylase is acve.**

You are tesng the ability of amylase to hydrolyze starch under different condions over a period
of me. First you will combine amylase with a starch soluon in a microfuge tube then you will
test for starch digeson by adding the amylase/starch mixture to Lugol°Øs iodine and note the color
change. You will repeat the addion every 3 minutes filling adjacent wells on your mulwell plate.

## 6.2 Effect of Temperature on Amylase Activity

13. Place the microfuge tube back in its respective water bath and continue to incubate the tube
for 3 more minutes, for a total of 6 minutes.

## 6.3 Effect of pH on Amylase Activity


Water molecules can dissociate or break into two parts, hydroxide ions (OH [] ) and hydrogen ions

(H [+] ; a.k.a. protons). In pure water this happens at a frequency of 1 in every 554 million water

molecules. This creates a very low concentraon of H [+] in pure water. The concentraon of H [+]
(writen as [H [+] ]) in pure water is 0.0000001 Molar (M) or using scienfic notaon 1 °ø 10 [7] M (or
10 [7] M).


pH is defined as the inverse log of the H [+] concentraon (pH = log 10 [H [+] ]). If you solve the same
equaon for [H [+] ], [H [+] ] = 10 [pH] . Therefore, a soluon with a hydrogen ion concentraon of 10 [7] M

has a pH of 7. A pH of 7 is neutral. A neutral substance has equal concentraons of H [+] and OH [] .


In Figure 2, note that a soluon with a hydrogen ion concentraon of 0.001 M (10 [3] M) has a

much higher concentraon of H [+] (10,000°ø more) than a soluon with a hydrogen concentraon
of 0.0000001 (10 [7] M). The soluon with the higher hydrogen ion concentraon (10 [3] ) has a pH
of 3. The soluon with a lower hydrogen ion concentraon (10 [7] ) has a pH of 7. The lower the

number on the pH scale, the higher the concentraon of hydrogen ions in the soluon.


Unit 6 | Factors Influencing Amylase Activity

Revised 7/31/2023


A neutral substance has equal concentraons of H [+] and OH [], and a pH of 7. When addional

protons are added to water (which happens when an acid is added), the concentraon of

hydrogen atoms increases. Any pH _less_ than 7 is considered acidic. When the proton

concentraon is reduced (such as what occurs when adding a base), the pH increases. Any pH

_greater_ than 7 is considered basic or alkaline.

Environmental pH can have significant influence in biology. Like temperature, pH can affect the
acvity of an enzyme. The pH in a biological environment that is too high or too low can cause an

enzyme to denature. There is an opmal pH at which the enzyme°Øs acvity will be greatest. In this

procedure you will learn how to measure pH and determine the opmal pH for amylase acvity.

_Q4: What is the optimal pH for amylase activity as supported by your data?_

### **EXERCISE 4: BUFFERING CAPACITY AND ENZYME ACTIVITY**

Buffering capacity is measured by how much a soluon resists change in its pH when acid or base
is added. A soluon has a _high_ buffering capacity when it resists changes in pH when an acid or
base is added. A soluon has a _low_
buffering capacity when the pH changes fairly quickly when
an acid or base is added.


Buffering requires a weak acid/weak base pair present in a soluon. An example is carbonic acid
(H 2 CO 3 ) and its conjugate base the bicarbonate ion (HCO 3 [-] ).


Carbonic acid acts as a weak acid, able to donate protons when a base is added. When acid

(protons) is added, the soluon is able to absorb the protons using the conjugate base, the
bicarbonate ion, reforming carbonic acid. In either scenario the effect on the pH of the soluon
is minimized by the presence of the weak acid and conjugate base pair. This reacon occurs in

both direcons: note the double headed arrow shown in Figure 3.

## 6.4 Effect of Cofactors on Amylase Activity (Optional)

Many enzymes require cofactors to maintain biological acvity. Cofactors are non-protein

molecules or metal ions. Ca [++] and Mg [++] are examples of enzyme cofactors. Chelang agents can

bind and remove metal ions from soluon. One chelator is EGTA (ethylene glycol-bis-(•‚
aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'- tetra acec acid). EGTA binds Ca [++] ions and prevents them from

interacng with enzymes. If the enzyme cannot interact with a cofactor it requires, it will not be

able to funcon.

### **OPTIONAL EXERCISE 5: EFFECT OF COFACTORS ON AMYLASE ACTIVITY**


In this experiment you will determine if amylase requires a metal ion cofactor such as Ca [++] . If

cofactors are involved in the enzymac acvity of amylase, the presence of EGTA should reduce
the effecveness of amylase.

### Preparing the multiwell plate:

1. Obtain a multiwell plate and label the first 3 rows 0 mM, 10 mM, and 20 mM. These are the
millimolar (mM) concentrations of the chelator EGTA you will be testing.


2. Add 100 •ÏL of iodine to 6 of the wells of each of the first three rows you just labeled.


3. Add 200 •ÏL of starch solution into the first well **only** of the first three rows. These wells should
turn black and will serve as a positive control (positive for starch, negative for amylase
activity.)

### Preparing the reaction mixture:

4. For the reaction mixture, label 3 microfuge tubes (0 mM EGTA, 10 mM EGTA, and 20 mM
EGTA).


5. Add 250 •ÏL of diH2O to the 0 mM EGTA tube.


6. Add 250 •ÏL of the 10 mM EGTA solution to the 10 mM EGTA tube.


7. Add 250 •ÏL of the 20 mM EGTA solution to the 20 mM EGTA tube.


8. Add 250 •ÏL of amylase solution to each of the three EGTA tubes, close and invert to mix.


_Tip: You can perform the experiment with all three tubes simultaneously._


9. Allow the tubes to incubate at room temperature for 1 minute.


10. Add 750 •ÏL of starch solution to each of the three EGTA tubes, close and invert to mix.


11. The reactions will incubate at room temperature. Start a timer and incubate the tubes for 3

minutes.

### Testing amylase activity:

12. After 3 minutes, invert to remix the three tubes.


13. Add 200 •ÏL of the solution in the 0 mM tube to the 2nd well in row 0 mM on your plate.

the plate.


15. Continue to incubate the tubes for 3 more minutes, for a total of 6 minutes.


16. Invert tubes to mix and then repeat steps 12-15 (except you will add the reaction mixture to
the 3rd well) and record color observed at the 6-minute time point.

20. Invert to mix tubes and then repeat steps 12-15 (except you will add the reaction mixture to
the 5th well) and record color observed at the 12-minute time point.


21. Continue to incubate the tube for 3 more minutes for a total of 15 minutes.


22. Invert to mix tubes and then repeat steps 12-15 (except you will add the reaction mixture to
the 6th well) and record color observed at the 15-minute time point.


23. Observe and record the color of the solution in all of the wells of your plate for each different
concentration of EGTA.


_Q13: Did the activity of amylase change when EGTA was added?_
