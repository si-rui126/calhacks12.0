## 7.1 Factors Affecting Diffusion

**Diffusion** is the movement of molecules from an area where their concentraon is high to an area
where their concentraon is low. The rate of diffusion is dependent on several factors such as
temperature and size of the molecule. (Rate is a measure of distance over me. For example, your

car°Øs speedometer records MPH, or miles per hour.)

### **EXERCISE 1: ASSESSING THE EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE AND** **MOLECULAR MASS ON THE RATE OF DIFFUSION**

In this exercise you will conduct an experiment to test the effect of temperature and molecular
weight (mass) on the rate of diffusion of two dye molecules. In your lab notebook, answer the
following quesons to help you determine the hypotheses you will test in this exercise.


_Q1: What do you expect will happen to the rate of diffusion as temperature increases?_


_Q2: What do you expect will happen to the rate of diffusion as the mass of the molecule changes?_


_**TABLE 1:**_ _This table shows the available temperatures and dyes in the lab._

|Temperature Conditions: Dyes (2 of the following):|Col2|
|---|---|
|37°∆C (incubator)|Methylene Blue (molecular mass = 319.85 Daltons)|
|23°∆C (room temperature)|Congo Red (molecular mass = 696.67 Daltons)|
|0°∆C (ice bath/refrigerator)|Indigo Carmine Blue (molecular mass = 466.36 Daltons)|
||Potassium permanganate (molecular mass = 158.03 Daltons)|



1. Obtain 3 agar plates, one for each temperature condition.


2. Label the plates for the temperature they will be incubated in and your table/group number.


3. Make 2 wells in each plate using a straw as shown in Figure 1.

4. Place one drop of the first dye in one well of each of the agar plates and one drop of the
second dye in the second well of each plate. Make sure not to drip outside of the well.


5. Immediately after adding the drops, use a ruler to measure the diameter of the dye on the
plates. This will be the initial measurement. Record your results.


6. One of the three plates will be placed in the 37°∆C incubator, one will be placed at room
temperature (23°∆C), and a third will be placed at 0°∆C. Start a timer for 20 minutes.


7. Record the distance traveled by the dye by measuring the diameter of the dye after 20
minutes and 40 minutes. Construct a table in your notebook to record your results. Your table
should include dye color, temperature incubated, and dye diameter at 0, 20, and 40 minutes
(see Table 2).


_**TABLE 2:**_ _Results from agar diffusion plate experiment._

|TEMPERATURE °∆CELSIUS|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|Col6|Col7|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|~~DISTANCE IN CM AT TIME~~<br>= 0 MIN<br>|<br>||||||
|~~DISTANCE IN CM AT TIME~~<br>= 20 MIN<br>|<br>||||||
|~~DISTANCE IN CM AT TIME~~<br>= 40 MIN|||||||



8. Draw a line graph of your results (distance vs. time) for the dye movement at 37°∆C with time
on the X-axis and distance on the Y-axis. Use two different colored pencils to represent the
two dyes. Your graph should include a title, axis labels (with units), and a legend.


9. Evaluate your results by answering the following questions in your lab notebook:


_Q3: What happened to the rate of diffusion as temperature increased?_


_Q4: Why do you think the rate changed this way?_


_Q5: Which dye had a lower molecular weight?_


_Q6: How did the size of the molecule change the rate of diffusion?_


_Q7: Were your predictions correct?_

## 7.2 Selective Permeability of Membranes

All living organisms are made up of one or more cells. Cells are filled with a semi-liquid substance
called cytosol surrounded by a cell membrane composed mainly of amphipathic phospholipids

arranged in a bilayer. Nonpolar substances such as lipids and small uncharged molecules can pass

easily through a membrane, but hydrophilic molecules cannot and must pass through specialized

protein channels. Thus, cell membranes are selecvely permeable.


BIOL 1406 | Lab Manual


Revised 2/18/2024


The funcon of the plasma membrane is to protect the cell and regulate the movement of

molecules and ions into and out of the cell. An important characterisc of the plasma membrane

is its selecve permeability. Dialysis bags will be used in this experiment to simulate the selecve

permeability of the plasma membrane. Iodine and other reagents will be used to verify the
diffusion of molecules across the membrane.


_**FIGURE 2:**_ _Dialysis bag and beaker setup._

Dialysis bags have microscopic pores of a specific size which only allow molecules of a certain size
to pass across. For example, a dialysis bag may have a 14,000 Dalton (Da) cut off indicang it will
not allow molecules that are larger to pass across. The solutes you will be using in this diffusion
experiment are iodine (~127 Da), starch (>2 °ø 10 [6] Da), and amylase (~58,000 Da).

### **EXERCISE 2: TESTING THE SELECTIVE PERMEABILITY OF DIALYSIS** **TUBING** Preparing the control group:

1. Obtain a dialysis bag. Twist one side of the bag then tie it using a piece of twine.


2. Add 10 mL of 1% starch solution and 5 mL of diH 2 O to the dialysis bag. Twist and tie the other
side of the bag. Rinse the bag and dry using a paper towel.


3. Fill a 400 mL beaker with 125 mL of diH 2 O and add a magnetic stir bar.


4. Add 10 mL of Lugol°Øs iodine to the beaker.


5. Place the dialysis bag in the beaker containing water and iodine.


6. Record the initial color of the solution in the bag and the color of the solution in the beaker.


7. Let the bag sit in the beaker for at least 10 minutes while stirring on the plate.


8. Remove the bag from the beaker, place it in a weigh boat, and record the color of the
solutions in the beaker and the bag.


9. _Keep both the bag and beaker until the end of class._

## 7.3 Effect of Different Tonicities on Plant and Animal Cells


Unlike lipids and small uncharged molecules, water is a polar, hydrophilic molecule and cannot

easily cross a membrane because of the hydrophobic phospholipid tails that make up the bilayer°Øs

interior. In order to allow water to pass freely, specialized protein channels called aquaporins
reside in the membrane to facilitate the movement of water (this is facilitated diffusion). When a
cell is placed in a soluon of higher solute concentraon (a hypertonic soluon, like sugar water)

compared to the inside of the cell, water will exit the cell in order to equalize the concentraon

of solutes within and outside of the cell. If a cell is placed in a soluon of a very low solute

concentraon (a hypotonic soluon, like diH 2 O), in comparison to the inside of the cell, the cell

will take up water for the same reason. When the concentraon of solutes is equal on both sides

of the plasma membrane, the cell is in an isotonic environment and there will be no net change

in concentraon, even though water will connue to move in and out of the cell.


_**FIGURE 3:**_ _Tonicity. (Connectivid-D, CC BY-SA 4.0, via Wikimedia Commons)_


The diffusion of water across a semipermeable membrane from a higher concentraon of water
to a lower concentraon of water is called **osmosis** . It may help you to remember that higher

concentraons of water are associated with lower concentraons of solute, and vice versa. The

push of water in or out of cells is called osmoc pressure; solute concentraons that might result
in osmoc pressure are referred to by their osmolarity, or tonicity. The effect of this water
movement is dependent upon whether a cell has a rigid cell wall outside of its semi-permeable

cell membrane.


Unit 7 | Diffusion & Osmosis


84



Revised 2/18/2024


Plant cells in hypotonic soluons take up water and expand unl the water contained in the cell

exerts a force on the cell wall known as known as turgor. This makes the cell rigid and we say that

the cell is **turgid** . When placed in hypertonic soluons, plant cells lose water, and the plasma

membrane pulls away from the cell wall at several places. This process is known as **plasmolysis** .

On the other hand, animal cells shrivel when placed in a hypertonic soluon (this is called

**crenaon** ) but will swell and may burst ( **lyse** ) when placed in a hypotonic soluon.

### **EXERCISE 4: TESTING THE EFFECT OF VARIOUS TONICITIES ON PLANT** **AND ANIMAL CELLS**


In this experiment you will visualize both plant and animal cells exposed to environments of
different tonicies. Based on the appearance of the cells, you will determine the environment°Øs
tonicity compared to the cells.


Predict what will occur when animal cells or plant cells are placed in various tonicity condions.

Think about how you can determine the tonicity of a soluon based on the appearance of the

cells when placed in that soluon. Write the predicons in your lab notebook using the suggested
format below by filling in the blanks using the terminology introduced in the lab manual.


**Suggested Format:**


Animal cells will appear _______________ when the cells are placed in a solution that is
_hypertonic_ to the cytoplasm of the cells but will appear _______________ when placed in a
solution that is _hypotonic_ to the cytoplasm of the cells.


Animal cells prefer to be in a _________________ solution in which they appear round and
neither gain nor lose water.


Plant cells will appear _______________ when the cells are placed in a solution that is
_hypertonic_ to the cytoplasm of the cells but will appear _______________ when placed in a
solution that is _hypotonic_ to the cytoplasm of the cells.


Plant cells prefer to be in a _________________ solution in which they appear full and neither
gain nor lose water.

### Procedure for Animal Cells
