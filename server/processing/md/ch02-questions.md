**Chapter 2 Practice Problems**


These are not for a grade. Don¡¯t turn them in. They are strictly

for extra practice to give you more opportunities to code the

topics we covered in the chapter.


I will upload a second document entitled Ch2_PracticeAnswers

that will hold all of the answers to the problems on this page.


If you are working these extra practice problems and need help,

reach out to me. That¡¯s what I¡¯m here for  to assist you in your

learning.


Let¡¯s get to it!

1. Complete the table by determining the values of each expression.

|Expression Value|Col2|
|---|---|
|**28 / 4  2**||
|**4 + 8 * 2**||
|**6 + 17 % 3 - 2**||
|**2 + 22 * (9  7)**||
|**(16 + 7) % 2  1**||
|**(9  3) * (2 + 2) / 3**||



2. Complete the following table by rewriting the statement given using combined assignment


operators.


|Statement Statement with Combined<br>Assignment Operator|Col2|
|---|---|
|**x = x + 5;**||
|**total = total + subtotal;**||
|**dist = dist / rep;**||

**Whole Programs**

3. The East Coast Sales division of a company generates 62% of total sales. Based upon that


percentage, write a program that will determine how much the East Coast Division will generate

if the overall company has 4.6 million in sales this year.

4. A program is needed to determine the total cost of a meal once tip and tax are added to the bill.


There is no user input yet, so create variables to hold the information you¡¯ll need. You¡¯ll need to

have a meal price, a tax rate (which is used to determine the amount of tax needed for the

meal), and a 20% tip. If your meal is 88.57 and your tax rate is 6.25%, Determine the total bill for

the evening. Show the meal price, tax paid, tip paid, and then total bill.

5. Write a program that asks the user to enter a golfer¡¯s score for three games of golf, and then


displays the average of the three scores. For the best practice, write this using both
text/console input with Scanner and with dialog boxes.
6. There are three categories of seats at a baseball stadium. Class A seats cost $40, Class B seats

cost $20, and Class C seats cost $8. Store the seat costs as constants. Write a program that asks

the user how many tickets for each class of seats were sold and then display the amount of
income generated from ticket sales. For the best practice, write this using both text/console

input with Scanner and with dialog boxes.
